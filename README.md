This assignment that was done during an Operating Systems course involved semaphore creation and management in order to program a process scheduler that followed different scheduling algorithms. Pipes were also implemented to allow communication between processes. In xinu, the way processes are created and used is similar to threads in linux systems

Most files modified in the xinu-os are in the 'system' folder. 

Some main files modified include:
clkhandler.c
create.c
getc.c
getbuf.c
getitem.c
init.c
initialize.c
insert.c
pipconnect.c
pipcreate.c
pipwrite.c
ready.c
receive.c
resched.c
semcount.c
